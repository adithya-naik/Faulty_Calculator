# Faulty Calculator

## Introduction

I've developed a quirky calculator that, despite its occasional hiccups, manages to provide correct results most of the time. It's like having a mischievous little math gremlin living inside your device! ðŸ™ƒ

## Features

1. *Random Calculation Errors: Approximately* *10%* of the time, this calculator will produce incorrect results. It's like playing a game of mathematical roulette!

2. *Unconventional Operators*:
   - instead of `+` it performs `-`
   - instead of `*` it performs `+`
   - instead of `-` it performs `/`
   - instead of `/` it performs `**`

Remember, this calculator is for entertainment purposes only. Use it at your own risk (and maybe keep a backup calculator handy). ðŸ˜„
